# CW-PAP-Tool
The method for this has been public for a hell of a long time now, so I figured I would take the initiative and finally release a public tool for this

Whipped this together in a couple of hours, I dont have a proper check to make sure the game is open but it takes like 12 combined braincells to go ahead and add that

Other than that, compile in Release x64 mode and make sure you dont have any 3rd party anticheats that could potentially block any features (like Riot Vanguard for example)
